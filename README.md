# How to Use

1. Generate a copy of this template by clicking on `Use this template` --> `Create a new repository`. I recommended to make it public.
2. In your new repo, change the URLs in `sites.json` to the URLs of the websites you wish to keep alive.
3. And... that's it. Depending on where you live, you may want to adjust the times in `.github/workflows/main.yml`
